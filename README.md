# Tokenized Contract Lifecycle Risk Assessment System

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing contract risk assessment throughout the entire lifecycle, from analyst verification to remediation management.

## Overview

This system provides a complete solution for decentralized cybersecurity compliance through five interconnected smart contracts that manage:

- **Contract Risk Analyst Verification**: Validates and manages certified risk analysts
- **Risk Evaluation**: Conducts comprehensive contract risk assessments
- **Mitigation Planning**: Creates and manages risk mitigation strategies
- **Monitoring Coordination**: Coordinates ongoing risk monitoring activities
- **Remediation Management**: Manages risk remediation processes and tracks progress

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. Analyst Verification Contract (\`analyst-verification.clar\`)
- Registers and verifies contract risk analysts
- Manages analyst certifications and specializations
- Tracks analyst performance metrics
- Validates analyst credentials for system access

#### 2. Risk Evaluation Contract (\`risk-evaluation.clar\`)
- Submits and manages risk evaluations
- Calculates aggregate risk scores
- Categorizes risks by type and severity
- Provides evaluation approval workflows

#### 3. Mitigation Planning Contract (\`mitigation-planning.clar\`)
- Creates comprehensive mitigation plans
- Manages implementation tasks and timelines
- Tracks plan progress and completion
- Handles plan approvals and status updates

#### 4. Monitoring Coordination Contract (\`monitoring-coordination.clar\`)
- Schedules automated and manual monitoring
- Manages monitoring results and alerts
- Coordinates analyst assignments
- Provides alert subscription services

#### 5. Remediation Management Contract (\`remediation-management.clar\`)
- Creates and manages remediation processes
- Tracks remediation progress and effectiveness
- Manages team assignments and approvals
- Calculates cost and effectiveness metrics

4. Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet/mainnet

## Usage

### 1. Register Analysts
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .analyst-verification register-analyst 
  'ST1ANALYST... 
  u3 
  "Smart Contract Security")
\`\`\`

### 2. Submit Risk Evaluation
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .risk-evaluation submit-evaluation
  0x1234... ;; contract-hash
  u1        ;; analyst-id
  u75       ;; risk-score
  "High"    ;; risk-category
  "Critical vulnerabilities found"
  "Immediate remediation required")
\`\`\`

### 3. Create Mitigation Plan
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .mitigation-planning create-mitigation-plan
  u1        ;; evaluation-id
  0x1234... ;; contract-hash
  u1        ;; priority
  "Immediate code review and patching"
  "Step 1: Review, Step 2: Patch"
  u5000     ;; estimated-cost
  u30       ;; timeline
  'ST1TEAM...) ;; assigned-to
\`\`\`

### 4. Schedule Monitoring
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .monitoring-coordination create-monitoring-schedule
  0x1234... ;; contract-hash
  "automated"
  u100      ;; frequency
  u1        ;; assigned-analyst
  u80)      ;; alert-threshold
\`\`\`

### 5. Create Remediation
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .remediation-management create-remediation
  u1        ;; plan-id
  0x1234... ;; contract-hash
  u3        ;; severity
  "Critical security vulnerability"
  "Apply security patch and test"
  'ST1TEAM... ;; assigned-team
  u200)     ;; target-completion
\`\`\`

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive test suites using Vitest:

- \`tests/analyst-verification.test.ts\`
- \`tests/risk-evaluation.test.ts\`
- \`tests/mitigation-planning.test.ts\`
- \`tests/monitoring-coordination.test.ts\`
- \`tests/remediation-management.test.ts\`

Run tests with:
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper authorization checks
- Input validation prevents invalid data entry
- Cross-contract calls ensure data integrity
- Error handling prevents unexpected failures

## Gas Optimization

- Efficient data structures minimize storage costs
- Optimized function calls reduce transaction fees
- Batch operations where possible
- Minimal redundant data storage

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external risk assessment APIs
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-signature approval workflows
- Automated remediation triggers
- Integration with insurance protocols
